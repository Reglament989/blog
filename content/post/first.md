## Introduction

This blog become starting point to our journey in my dev world.
Here I been post my success and failure over time.
Introducing new things what im learned.
Provide quickstart guides for major and new tech stacks which I used

## About me

I'm 19 years old, software developer, primary I'm using Rust for myself and TS for work :(
My mainstream is blockchain/backend, with a little bit of overingenering :)
I'd like to build high performance and technically perfect applications + designs
Currently I'm working on Omisoft, using TS, Solidity and we trying a little bit of Rust

## Side-Projects

Now I'm working on decentralized chat server, maybe for future there be a frontend on Flutter.
But its depends on time and interest of project. Main feature be a federations and routing,
where A can send message to C without access to C via B, A -> B -> C.
There i find intresting use tonic (grpc) with redis stack, but I heavly want to build this on top of WebTransport.
But on time writing there no implimentation on rust.. some individuals trying to investigate their time, for now its not usable.
